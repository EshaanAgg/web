[![Built with Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v1/built-with-astro.svg)](https://astro.build)

A minimal, responsive, and accessible personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It contain's a brief summary about all the aspects of my journey as a Software Developer and even hosts my ramblings in the blog section!

## Tech stack

- **Platform**: [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro)
- **Deployment**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- **Package manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- **OG-images**: [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori)

## Setting up the Site Locally

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev

```

## Key Features

- The site is fully repsonsive and is shipped with ZERO JavaScript.
- We use Astro's `content` directory to manage all the blogs in Markdown.

## Credits

The site has been inspired by [Kevin Zuniga Cuellar](https://github.com/kevinzunigacuellar/web)'s personal website and draws a lot of styling from the same. This is an attempt to modify the same according to my use, and add newer and more descriptive templates.
