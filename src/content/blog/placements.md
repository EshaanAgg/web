Hey! This is a brief recap of my journey of placements as a final year student at IIT (BHU). I will be sharing my experiences & some tips and resources that I had accumulated during the placements process. I have also curated some blogs where I will be sharing all the online assessment questions that I have come across during the tests, as they might be repeated in the future by many companies, or might help you in gaining some insights into the type of questions that are asked.

This is a humble attempt to curate the resources that I wish I had, so please let me know it they helped you in any way! Also feel free to raise an issue [here](https://github.com/EshaanAgg/web/issues) if you have any find any mistakes or have any suggestions in the content.

Much thanks to all the seniors and friends who helped me in this journey, and for even helping with many of these resources and problems. It wouldn't have been possible without them.

Cheers and all the best for your placements!
