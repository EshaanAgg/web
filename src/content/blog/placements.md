Hey! This is a brief recap of my journey of placements as a final year student at IIT (BHU). I will be sharing my experiences, some tips and resources that I had accumulated dusring the placements process. I have also curated some blogs where I will be sharing all the online assessment questions that I have come across during my tests for the same, as they might be repeated in the future by many companies, or might help you in gaining some insights into the type of questions that are asked in the placements process.

These are a humble attempting to curate the resources that I wish I had, so please let me know it they helped you in any way. Also feel free to raise an issue [here](https://github.com/EshaanAgg/web/issues) if you have any queries or suggestions for the same.
