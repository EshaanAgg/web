Well, it took me a lot of denial and headbanging, but I have finally came to the realization that you _need to learn CSS_ too, as you do with any other language that you are fond of. Just throwing `flex` everywhere and hoping that your content will fall into place, or copying snippets from CodePen amoung others is not a feasible way to develop sites! ðŸ˜¦

Though I believe I'm no good at CSS, I have found that using the following snippets and tricks make me "less bad" at working with this language of gods. Here's to hoping that these can help you too! ðŸš€
