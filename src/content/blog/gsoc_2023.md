Hey! I am [Eshaan Aggarwal](https://eshaanagg.netlify.app) and I was fortunate enough to be selected into the prestigious [GSoC (Google Summer of Code) 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) under the [Palisadoes Foundation](https://www.palisadoes.org/). I have worked on the [Improving Event Management in Talawa Admin](https://www.palisadoes.org/news/2023/05/04/5706/) for the last 5 months, and am very glad to annouce it's culmination and successful completion! Here is a brief overview of the work I had done during this period.

## Executive Summary

As my project had the primary scope of adding various event management capabilities to the Talawa ecosystem, I had worked on the both the backend and frontend for providing the support for the following functionalities:

- Allowing events to have projects, which they have tasks, which are used for the organization of the event
- Allow assigning of volunteers to tasks and their tracking
- Adding registrations and check in for the events
- Automatic tag generation for event attendees
- Anonymous feedback system for attendees
- Event statistics and visualizations for the event data

In addition to achieving these goals, I had also worked with two other short term deliverables that are worth mentioning:

- Updating the designed UI of the Talawa Admin Portal to the design developed as a part of the simultaneously running Admin UI Redesign project.
- Upgration of the backend repository from `Apollo Server 2` to `Apollo Server 3` to prevent blocking updates to the backend. (I had great help in this due to my fellow contributor, [Kanishka Bansode](https://github.com/kb-0311!)!)

All of these changes were accompanied by 100% test coverage as per the contribution policy of the Talawa projects!

In all, this project has greatly expanded the event management capabilities of the Talawa Admin as the Talawa API, enabling the Palisadoes Foundation to be a step closer to devloping a MVP that can be used by communities globally.

## Conclusion

I am proud of the work I have accomplished during the GSoC 2023 program, and I would like to express my gratitude to [Dominic Mills](https://github.com/DMills27) and [Peter Harrison](https://github.com/palisadoes) sir for their guidance and support throughout this journey. They were always available for me, and provided me a supportive and understanding enviornment which allowed me to finish my project, while managing all my other commitments.

This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons about project management and collaboration in an open-source community. I am excited to continue contributing to the Palisadoes Foundation and the open-source community in the future.

Thank you for this incredible opportunity. Cheers!
